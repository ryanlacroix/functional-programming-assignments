COMP3007 Assignment 3

All code belongs to me with the exception of the majority of the Metacircular interpreter. All let related functions contained within the interpreter do however belong to me.

----------Question 1----------
Testing is contained within the Question1.rkt file.

----------Question 2----------
All contour diagrams for question 2 are contained in Question2.pdf

----------Question 3----------
a) See Question3a.pdf

b) The expected output using lexical scoping is 300.

c) This code works using dynamic scoping, however returns a different result. The set! in in2 affects the z from in1 as opposed to the z in outer's scope. This results in an output of 520.

----------Question 4----------
(let ((a 12)) (* a 2))
;;; M-Eval value:
24

(let ((a 2) (b 3))(+ b a))
;;; M-Eval value:
5

(let ((a "spa") (z "ghetti")) (cons a z))
;;; M-Eval value:
(spa . ghetti)

(let ((bob (cons 3 7))(bbob 7))(cons "bob" (cons bbob bob)))
;;; M-Eval value:
(bob 7 3 . 7)
