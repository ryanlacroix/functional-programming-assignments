Readme for COMP 3007 Assignment 2

The assignment is written in R5RS custom, as set up in class. All test results are given in testing.txt. All questions and testing in the file are presented in the order in which they are given on the assignment.
Note that the function 'first' in question 3b) has been renamed to 'triple-first' in order to avoid a name collision with a function in 7a) with the same name.
